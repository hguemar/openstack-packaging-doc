Introduction
------------

This document collects guidelines and practical tips


Packaging Guidelines
--------------------

RDO packages mostly follow {fedora-packaging-guidelines}[Fedora Packaging Guidelines].
There are two exceptions:

 * Override rules listed in this document.
 * Exceptions granted by RDO Packaging Group (e.g. bundling)

Packages Review Process
-----------------------

All reviews **must** block the review tracker using the alias RDO-<release>-REVIEW.
Announcing reviews on the RDO mailing list is encouraged to raise awareness within the
community and speed up the process.

General-purpose libraries and clients should be submitted through Fedora Package Review
{fedora-packages-review-process}[Process].

As for OpenStack services, they should follow the same process but open a ticket under
the **RDO** product and **Package Review** component. Packagers are encouraged to create
a git repository with their packaging for pre-review.

For reviewers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reviewers are encouraged to use fedora-review tool to generate and post formal review
on the ticket.

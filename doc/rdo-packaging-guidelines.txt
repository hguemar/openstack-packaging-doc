Introduction
------------

This document collects guidelines and practical tips


Packaging Guidelines
--------------------

RDO packages mostly follow {fedora-packaging-guidelines}[Fedora Packaging Guidelines].
There are two exceptions:

 * Override rules listed in this document.
 * Exceptions granted by RDO Packaging Group (e.g. bundling)

Packages Review Process
-----------------------

All reviews **must** block the review tracker using the alias RDO-<release>-REVIEW.
Announcing reviews on the RDO mailing list is encouraged to raise awareness within the
community and speed up the process.

General-purpose libraries and clients should be submitted through Fedora Package Review
{fedora-packages-review-process}[Process].

As for OpenStack services, they should follow the same process but open a ticket under
the **RDO** product and **Package Review** component. Packagers are encouraged to create
a git repository with their packaging for pre-review.

For reviewers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reviewers are encouraged to use fedora-review tool to generate and post formal review
on the ticket.


RDO Guidelines
--------------

Systemd packaging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* All services must be configured to allow automated restart (Restart=[on-failure|always])


General guidelines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Remove requirements files used by pip to download dependencies from the network.
That may hide missing dependencies or integration issues (e.g. a dependency package only available in an incompatible version)

[source,bash]
rm -rf {,tests-}requirements.txt

* Use versioned python macros everywhere.

* Check your package dependencies with ```rdopkg reqcheck```.

* To enforce consistency accross OpenStack services packages, use the following snippet to set upstream project name.

[source,bash]
%global service keystone


Configuration files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Use oslo-config-generator to generate configuration files.

[source,bash]
oslo-config-generator --config-file=config-generator/keystone.conf

* Configuration files must be in /etc and not /usr/etc.


Patches
~~~~~~~

RDO is and intends to remain a vanilla distribution of OpenStack.
Our default policy is to refuse downstream patches, but RDO Packaging Group may grant
exceptions on per-case basis

* Feature patches: must be submitted upstream

* Security patches: requires RDO Security team clearance.

* FTBFS patches: requires peer review, and must be submitted upstream when possible.
